The project focused on two primary objectives: analyzing trip data in Haifa to construct an origin-destination matrix based on time and day; Predicting travel durations within the city using the initial trip data. 
This project involving the analysis of travel data using Pandas and the development of a neural network model using Keras. 

In this project I built a model that tries to predict travel times in the city of Haifa based on data about previous trips provided by the Municipality of Haifa, which contain information on segments of trips: a unique identifier for the passenger, the date and time of the start of the trip, the date and time of the end of the trip, the starting point and the ending point. These data describe trips during the month of November 2021 in the city of Haifa. Another goal (but earlier in terms of the chronological axis) that I set before me is to analyze the travel data in the city and build a matrix of destinations in the city - origin and destination by hours and days.
Correct analysis of the data and successful prediction of the duration of the car journey will ultimately be useful in the future to make better predictions of the journey duration applicable to multiple cities and an understanding of the passenger's needs in order to strengthen public transportation in the city of Haifa (and other cities later on).
